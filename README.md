# Eye-OF-Horus
Eye of Horus is a web app we designed to solve our challenge “set your sights high”. It’s a simulation of the earth, the surrounding satellites, space debris and displays all of their information and data when asked to, like an interactive 3D map. It’s made with HTML, CSS, JS and open sources (Three.min.js and Tween.js). This app can be used as a new field of education. The app is super simple to reach and use as it's an open-free source, and it satisfies the curiosity and passion to learn. <a herf="https://psycho-seif.github.io/Eye-of-horus/">Try</a>
